    description: "TODO and FIXME comments should reference an issue number or have a plan"
    severity: "warning"

  - category: "Code Quality"
    rule: "Functions are not too long"
    description: "Functions should be concise (ideally under 50 lines). Long functions should be refactored"
    severity: "info"

  - category: "Code Quality"
    rule: "Meaningful variable names"
    description: "Variables should have clear, descriptive names that indicate their purpose"
    severity: "info"

  - category: "Best Practices"
    rule: "No commented-out code"
